Gussian Sampling Generation

Multivariate Gaussian distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning that finds applications in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, and natural language processing. It is a probability distribution that describes the probability of multiple random variables being correlated with each other. The process of generating random samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution can be challenging, particularly when the dimensionality of the data is high. In this post, we will explore the topic of sampling from a multivariate Gaussian distribution and provide Python code examples to help you understand and implement this concept.

The goal of this project is to generate Gaussian samples in 2-D from uniform samples, the latter of which can be readily generated using built-in random number generators in most computer languages.
